# GODSPEED

**I build production infrastructure from scratch and run it on my own iron. No cloud providers. No vendor lock-in. Just working systems that solve real problems.**

Low-level systems programming • Self-hosted everything • C/C++/Python/Bash • Language agnostic when it matters

---

## Current Work

### [second-brain-stack](https://github.com/Trafexofive/second-brain-stack)
Self-hosted knowledge management with AI search, knowledge graphs, and conversational interfaces. FastAPI + SQLite + vector search + RAG. Production-ready semantic search over everything I know.

### [SimpleCrawler-MK4](https://github.com/Trafexofive/SimpleCrawler-MK4)
Microservices web crawling platform that transforms documentation into LLM-friendly structured data. FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Docker. Handles concurrent crawling, intelligent parsing, and data normalization at scale.

### [DeepSearchStack](https://github.com/Trafexofive/DeepSearchStack)
Self-hosted deep search with LLM integration, vector storage, multi-engine browsing, and intelligent caching. Aggregates results across multiple search engines, enriches with LLM analysis, and serves through a clean API.

## Self-Hosted Infrastructure

Everything runs on my bare metal:

**Core Services**
- Full email stack (SMTP, IMAP, spam filtering, encryption)
- Git server (zero GitHub dependency for critical code)
- Proxy layer (nginx, dynamic DNS, network-wide ad blocking)
- Media servers (music streaming, audiobooks, YouTube archival)

**Development Infrastructure**  
- CI/CD pipelines (zero-touch deployments: clone and `make up`)
- Database services (PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, Neo4j)
- LLM API servers (self-hosted Ollama, Whisper STT)
- Monitoring and logging (because if you don't measure it, you don't control it)

All managed as code. All version controlled. All understood at the system level.

## Philosophy

I treat infrastructure like a factory floor: optimize throughput, eliminate bottlenecks, automate everything, measure obsessively, iterate until bulletproof. Every service is a machine in a larger assembly line.

**Core principles:**
- Dependencies are technical debt - minimize or understand them completely
- Complexity is only justified when it enables emergent capabilities  
- Production is the only environment that matters - demos lie, production tells the truth
- If you don't understand it, you don't control it - build from scratch to truly learn
- Manual processes are inefficiencies waiting to be automated

**Why I build this way:**

My engineering approach is shaped by systems-thinking games: Factorio taught me about pipeline optimization and bottleneck analysis. Expert tech modpacks taught me that necessary complexity gates real capability. Dead Cells taught me fast iteration reveals truth.

I build tools that solve problems I actually have - personal infrastructure I use daily, solutions for my crew, systems that teach what copying never will. Everything here runs on hardware I control because data sovereignty and understanding matter more than convenience.

**Stack:**  
Arch Linux • Bare metal servers • C/C++/Python/Bash • Docker • Systemd • Neovim • Whatever solves the problem best

## Research Interests

Systems architecture and emergent complexity • AI agent orchestration and autonomy • LLM safety and alignment • Performance optimization at scale • Self-hosted infrastructure patterns • Quantitative analysis and algorithmic trading strategies • Low-level programming and hardware (assembly, embedded systems, FPGAs)
